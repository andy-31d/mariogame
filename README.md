# mariogame
A small project I worked on in my first year of college. It contains 5 levels in which Mario has to collect all stars on the map and avoid the brown mushrooms. However, Mario can kill them by jumping on top of them.

This was entirely implemented in C++ using CodeBlocks version 16.01 with the graphics.h and winbgim.h libraries for the GUI.
